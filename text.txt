Build a fully responsive product listing table using @tanstack/react-table v8. The table will display key product information and include functionality such as sorting, column visibility toggling, resizing, and adaptability to various screen sizes.
Data Model:
The table will display the following details for each product:
- Id: (string)
- Name: (string)
- Price: (string)
- Quality: (number, range: 1 to 5)
- Description: (string)
- Image URL: (string)


Table Features:
1. Responsiveness:
- The table should be fully responsive down to a minimum width of 800px.
- Between 800px and 1000px screen widths, implement a horizontal scroll if necessary.
2. Sorting:
- Enable sorting for all columns.
- Default sorting: Name column should be sorted in ascending order, while all other columns in descending order.
3. Column Visibility:
- Allow users to hide or show columns.
- The Name column must always be visible and pinned.
4. Column Resizing:
- Implement column resizing functionality using React Table v8's built-in features.
Project Specifications:
- Use React.js/Next.js for the frontend.
- Style the table with Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, or Material UI.
- Follow TypeScript strict rules to ensure type safety.
- Jest testing for the product listing table is optional but recommended for ensuring functionality.
- Mock the data for display; no real API calls should be made.
Acceptance Criteria:
- The table should render correctly with the provided data model.
- It should be responsive, with proper handling of screen widths between 800px and 1000px.
- Sorting, resizing, and column visibility toggling should work as expected.
- The Name column must always be visible and pinned, with other columns customizable.
- If included, Jest tests should ensure the table functions correctly.
